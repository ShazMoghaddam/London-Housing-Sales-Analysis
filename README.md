🏡 London Housing Sales Analysis (1995–2014)
📌 Project Overview
This analysis explores housing sales across London boroughs over a 20-year period (1995–2014). Using historical data, we reshaped, analyzed, and visualized trends 
in the number of housing transactions to better understand changes in housing market activity across different areas of London.

🔍 Key Analyses & Visualizations
1. 📈 Sales Trends Over Time — Selected Boroughs
We compared five boroughs: Barnet, Brent, Bexley, Camden, and Croydon.

All boroughs showed a noticeable dip around the 2008 financial crisis.

Recovery trends varied, with some boroughs bouncing back faster than others.

Camden and Barnet exhibited higher overall volumes and stronger rebounds post-2009.

2. 📊 Highest Growth in Sales (1995 → 2014)
We calculated the difference in total housing sales between 1995 and 2014 for each borough.

After removing the aggregate “England & Wales” row, the borough with the highest absolute growth in sales was:
Borough: [Insert Borough Name]
Growth: [Insert Sales Increase]
(This will dynamically update based on your actual data.)

3. 🔥 Heatmap — Boroughs vs. Years
We visualized the sales distribution using a heatmap:

Each row represents a borough; each column a year.

Lighter shades indicate higher sales volumes.

The heatmap clearly highlights:

Boroughs with consistent high activity (e.g., Barnet, Croydon).

The 2008–2009 dip across most boroughs.

Increasing activity in several boroughs after 2010.

📌 Summary of Findings
London's housing market experienced strong growth in many areas from 1995 to 2014.

The 2008 economic crisis caused a sharp decline in sales, followed by varying recovery rates.

Certain boroughs have significantly outpaced others in growth, showing more dynamic property markets.
